## SQLite3 Tips
### SQLite Viewer
* This extension helps you view, filter and sort the data in an SQL database in a format similar to Google Sheets. This is helpful if you want to check the results of your queries.
### Working with SQLite3 in the Terminal
* `sqlite3 [dbname].db` to enter the SQLite3 shell. If the database doesn't exist already, it creates a new one.
* `.schema` displays the schema of the database.
* `.quit` to exit the shell.
* If you want to run an SQL file without entering the shell, then run `sqlite3 [dbname].db < [filename].sql`.
